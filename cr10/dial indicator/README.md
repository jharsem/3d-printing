The dial indicator was based on a design from someone that I don't remember right now. Will ammend this file when I find out. It works with the original CR-10 print head and is unlikely to work with updated/modified designs. The concept is pretty simple however. You can likely whip up your preferred g-code based 'wipe' across the bed or x-point measurements by referring to the codes here: http://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/
